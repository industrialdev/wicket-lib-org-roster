# Cascade Strategy: Card Display

## Organization Screens
- Cascade mode uses organization-centric management screens.
- Primary heading remains `Manage Organizations`.

## Member List and Search
- Member cards/lists render via shared templates.
- Search and pagination behavior is shared across non-groups modes.
- Seat availability callouts and purchase actions use shared service outputs.

## Role Display
- Member-card role visibility follows shared UI config under `ui.member_card_fields`.
- Edit-permissions visibility uses shared non-groups UI toggles.
